============================== 
Quick-and-Dirty GUI for mid3v2
============================== 

A quick-and-dirty UI for mid3v2 to add and/or edit ID3-MP3-Tags of a whole talking book or a complete music collection at once. There are many, many, really many things to do, but this toolbox is usable already. 

------------------------ 
The used environment is:
------------------------ 
+ KUbuntu 16
+ Konsole
+ Firefox
+ bash

+ PHP 7.2.33 (CLI)
+ Python 3.5.2
+ Python-Mutagen 1.31
+  mid3v2 and mid3cp (part of Mutagen)

Some are prerequisites (like PHP, Python and Mutagen), others are interchangeable. For example, if you use Chromium instead of Firefox you must edit the shell scripts or do the steps manually. 

To start just click on a shell script (localhost8888-xxxx.sh).
